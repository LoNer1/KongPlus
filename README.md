# KongPlus
Official Kongregate+ GitHub

A community inspired project, aimed at improving the Kongregate userinterface. This project was inspired by the horrible design choices the front end developers made, which sparked a flame of critique amongst the users of it's site. This project aims to diminish these flaws in a stylish and sleek manner, whilst retaining functionality and authenticy.
